## Impementation of the breakthrough algorithm of Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey E. Hinton.
The function generate the AlexNet architecture as discribed in the paper from 2012.
I used Keras with Tensorflow as Backend for it.

AlexNet is the name of a convolutional neural network, designed by Alex Krizhevsky, and published with Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey Hinton.AlexNet competed in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge in 2012. The network achieved a top-5 error of 15.3%, more than 10.8 percentage points lower than that of the runner up. The original paper's primary result was that the depth of the model was essential for its high performance, which was computationally expensive, but made feasible due to the utilization of GPUs during training.

AlexNet contained eight layers -  the first five were convolutional layers, and the last three were fully connected layers. It used the non-saturating ReLU activation function, which showed improved training performance over tanh and sigmoid.
